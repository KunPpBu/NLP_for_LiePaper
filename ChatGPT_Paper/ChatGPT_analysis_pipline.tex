``A collection of tweets with the hashtag \#chatgpt : discussions about
the chatgpt language model, sharing experiences with using chatgpt, or
asking for help with chatgpt-related issues. The tweets could also
include links to articles or websites related to chatgpt, as well as
images, videos, or other media. Overall, a collection of tweets with the
hashtag \#chatgpt would provide a glimpse into the online conversation
surrounding chatgpt.''
